# nfc_catcher
I will try to make android app which catches nfc tags hidden arround building and gives you points for each of them.

2017-02-02: App divided into 2 apps - one only to use for admin (NFC Writter, PA02), second one is the real game (NFC Catcher, PA03).
NFC Writter gives you possibility to check what contains your tag, and possibility to overwrite (re-write) it.
NFC Catcher counts how many different tags you have scanned (it doesn't matter what tag contains, it only have to be different than other ones). Preparing game, you can edit source code to make set of "legal" tags and allow only them. I didn't, because I wrote my tags with totally random words :D
